## Contents
- 📘 Report (DOCX) - includes evidence, risk assessment, and recommendations.
- 🧭 Summary - newly registered domain, fake partnerships, and risky permission requests.

## Recommendations 
1. Don’t connect your real wallet; if testing, use a new empty one.  
2. Give X (Twitter) only “Read Only” access, then revoke it later.  
3. Check if brands like AVAX, Solana, or Animoca really mentioned this project (they didn’t).  
4. Warn others to remove wallet permissions and report phishing.
